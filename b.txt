This is my forst that i am going to code
for a project using GIT > then i will commit ( Saving it local git repo)

1. - Creat a file ( Workspace)
2-  Untill  unless i dont save it. 

3- To make GIT track this particular file git add filename
 4 - Save it git commit -m " Message"
5 - Push it to remote repositary.
